## ACTIVITY 1: Number Guessing Game🎲
>>>>>>> 59da543977e346ac87a40510acf3f0b0fad64fbb

This is a simple C# console game.  
The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 10, and you try to guess it.  
It shows how many attempts you made and lets you play again or quit.

### Features
- Random number between 1 and 10  
- Counts the number of attempts  
- Option to play again (Y/N)

## Activity 2: Git Commands
For this activity, I practiced using Git with the following commands:

- Commit  
- Push  
- Pull  
- Revert  
- Branch  

A new branch called **Edit-space** was created, which contains an added feature:  
the program now displays whether the guess is too high or too low.
